# LaundryMama

yaaaay!!
This is my project named "Laundry Mama"!So, this is basically a website of a laundry shop. Here, customers can order a service, can see their order list, can give their feedback and their feedback will be shown on the homepage! Admin can add new services, can see the orders list, and also can modify the state of the orders, make someone else an admin! This is quite responsive on laptops and mobiles!!

# I have used:HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javaScript, React, nodejs, MongoDb, Firebase, Heroku
